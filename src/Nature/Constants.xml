  <Add Code="ThermochemicalCalorie" Value="4.184" Units="J" ClrType="double" Quantity="Thermochemical calorie" Description=" In 1935, the thermochemical calorie was defined as exactly equal to 4.184 J. Historically, the calorie used to be defined as the energy needed to raise a gram of water by 1°C, just like the Btu (British thermal unit) was the energy to raise a pound of water by 1°F.  Such definitions depend on the initial temperature and thus gave rise to a multiplicity of units with the same name.  Also, using a finite increase in temperature (like 1°C or 1°F) in either definition made the factor of 1.8 reflect only approximately the effect of switching from the Fahrenheit to the Celsius scale (the factor is exact for the slopes of the relevant curves, or for equal temperature increments, not for different finite increments, no matter how small).  This is why the calorie is now defined precisely with the above mechanical equivalent in joules.  Unfortunately, this definition competes with the 1956 IST definition discussed below.  The trend seems to be that, unless otherwise specified, the calorie is to be understood as having the above thermochemical definition, whereas the Btu has the IST definition given in the following note.
