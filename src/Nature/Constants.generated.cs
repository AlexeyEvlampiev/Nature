The Sackur–Tetrode equation is named for Hugo Martin Tetrode (1895–1931) and Otto Sackur (1880–1914), who developed it independently as a solution of Boltzmann's gas statistics and entropy equations, at about the same time in 1912.

		/// <remarks>
		/// wikipedia:  In 1935, the thermochemical calorie was defined as exactly equal to 4.184 J. Historically, the calorie used to be defined as the energy needed to raise a gram of water by 1°C, just like the Btu (British thermal unit) was the energy to raise a pound of water by 1°F.  Such definitions depend on the initial temperature and thus gave rise to a multiplicity of units with the same name.  Also, using a finite increase in temperature (like 1°C or 1°F) in either definition made the factor of 1.8 reflect only approximately the effect of switching from the Fahrenheit to the Celsius scale (the factor is exact for the slopes of the relevant curves, or for equal temperature increments, not for different finite increments, no matter how small).  This is why the calorie is now defined precisely with the above mechanical equivalent in joules.  Unfortunately, this definition competes with the 1956 IST definition discussed below.  The trend seems to be that, unless otherwise specified, the calorie is to be understood as having the above thermochemical definition, whereas the Btu has the IST definition given in the following note.

		/// wikipedia: A cross section is the effective area which governs the probability of some scattering or absorption event. Together with particle density and path length, it can be used to predict the total scattering probability via the Beer-Lambert law. In nuclear and particle physics, the concept of a cross section is used to express the likelihood of interaction between particles. When particles in a beam are thrown against a foil made of a certain substance, the cross section  is a hypothetical area measure around the target particles of the substance (usually its atoms) that represents a surface. If a particle of the beam crosses this surface, there will be some kind of interaction.
